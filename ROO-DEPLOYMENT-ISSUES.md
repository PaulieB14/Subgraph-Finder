# Issues with Local Roo Deployment

## Why You Can't Deploy Locally to Test Roo

Based on our attempts, there are several issues that might be preventing you from deploying locally to test Roo:

1. **Roo CLI Package Not Available**: 
   The `@anthropic/roo-cli` package doesn't appear to be available in the public npm registry. When you tried to install it, you got a 404 error:
   ```
   npm error 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@anthropic%2froo-cli - Not found
   ```

2. **Possible Reasons**:
   - The package might be in a private registry that requires authentication
   - The package name might have changed or be different from what we're trying to use
   - Roo might not be available as an npm package at all
   - Roo might require special access or be in a closed beta

3. **Documentation Discrepancy**:
   The documentation at https://docs.roocode.com/ might be referring to a different installation method than what we're trying to use.

## Alternatives for Testing Your API

Since we can't get Roo working locally, here are some alternatives for testing your Subgraph Finder API:

1. **Use the Client Example**:
   ```bash
   cd standalone
   npm run example:client
   ```
   This will test all the API endpoints programmatically.

2. **Use curl**:
   ```bash
   # List all networks
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/networks
   
   # Find subgraphs by contract address
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/subgraphs/contract/0xd829c1d3649dbc3fd96d3d22500ef33a46daae46
   ```

3. **Use a Web Browser**:
   Visit these URLs in your browser:
   - http://localhost:3001/api/networks
   - http://localhost:3001/api/subgraphs/contract/0xd829c1d3649dbc3fd96d3d22500ef33a46daae46

4. **Use Postman or Similar API Testing Tools**:
   These tools provide a GUI for testing APIs and can be easier to use than curl.

## Next Steps for Roo Integration

If you still want to use Roo with your API, here are some suggestions:

1. **Contact Anthropic Support**:
   Reach out to Anthropic (the company behind Claude and presumably Roo) for information about Roo availability and installation.

2. **Check for Private Beta Programs**:
   Roo might be in a private beta program that requires special access.

3. **Look for Alternative Integration Methods**:
   There might be other ways to integrate your API with Gemini or other AI assistants.

4. **Wait for Public Release**:
   If Roo is in a private beta, it might become publicly available in the future.

## Current Status

Your Subgraph Finder API is working correctly and can be tested using the methods described above. The issue is specifically with the Roo integration, not with your API itself.
